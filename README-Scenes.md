# Scenes

There are three scenes at the moment:
1. Coil and Magnet. This scene is almost the same as the scene of my [MAP VR Project](https://github.com/mariomanalu/visualizing-magnetic-and-electric-fields-in-vr).
2. My Museum. This scene is the sandbox of this project. This is where I do my experiments, and for a while, I thought of making this scene the ultimate scene -- where users would spend most of their time in this game. But, the more I played with the environment, the more I realized that the design of the museum is not pleasing.
3. Brand New Museum. I was in the middle of creating a better museum environment, but I had too much class work that I could not finish it. Basically, the environment in this museum is the same as in the Coil and Magnet scene, except that I made some adjustments by creating room prefabs. I created these prefabs to make it easy to extend the museum in case we need to add more rooms.

## To Do
1. Consider finding a better museum model on the internet. At the time, the environment in the Coil and Magnet scene was the best free environment I could find on the Unity Asset Store site. Be on the lookout to see better and free environments. Free items can be found on the Unity Asset Store or some other sites. Just Google "Free Museum 3D Model" or "3D Building Models". There are great environments that are not free. Read the terms and agreement before purchasing a  proprietary model because we might not be able to publish the game if the publisher of the model does not grant us the right to publish.
2. Customize the environment by creating models and textures in Blender and import them into the scene.
